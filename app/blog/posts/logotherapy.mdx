## Stop Searching for Meaning — Create It Instead

Stop me if this sounds familiar: you know you want to build something meaningful, maybe even start a business, but every time you try to pinpoint your passion, you hit a wall. Everyone says, *“Follow your passion,”* but what if you don’t have a clear passion? What if nothing feels like your singular purpose?

If this is you, you’re not alone. The idea that meaning is something you have to 
“find” can leave you feeling stuck, even paralysed. But here’s the good news: 
meaning isn’t something you discover — it’s something you create. 

This is the cornerstone of logotherapy, a school of thought developed by Viktor E. Frankl, author of [*Man's Search For Meaning*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4069.Man_s_Search_for_Meaning). In the book, Frankl, a psychiatrist and a Holocaust survivor, recounts his experiences in Nazi concentration camps (including Auschwitz). Through the horrors he endured, Frankl discovered a profound truth: even in the face of immense suffering, we can find purpose by choosing how we respond.

Logotherapy builds on this idea, focusing on taking responsibility and finding purpose through action. It doesn’t require you to wait for inspiration to strike or a passion to magically reveal itself. Instead, it encourages you to create meaning by contributing to something greater than yourself — whether that’s a project, a business, or a cause.

In this post, you’ll learn how to embrace the idea that meaning is created, not discovered, and explore practical ways to apply this principle to your entrepreneurial journey. You don’t need a burning passion to get started — you just need the willingness to create.

## The Idea That Meaning Is Created, Not Discovered

For decades, people have been told to “find their purpose” or “follow their passion,” as if meaning is buried treasure waiting to be unearthed. But Frankl’s logotherapy turns this idea on its head. Instead of waiting for purpose to reveal itself, Frankl believed that meaning is something we create through our actions, choices, and contributions to the world.

Why does this matter for aspiring entrepreneurs? Because it frees you from the pressure of having to “know” exactly what your business should be about before you begin. The truth is, you don’t need to be passionate about your work at the start. Passion often grows as you build something meaningful and see its impact on others.

Frankl argued that we find meaning in three primary ways:
	1.	By creating something meaningful.
	2.	By experiencing something or someone deeply.
	3.	By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.

For (aspiring) entrepreneurs, the first — creating something meaningful — is particularly powerful. Let’s dive into how this works.

## Logotherapy’s First Avenue: Creating Something Meaningful

The act of creation is inherently purposeful. When you build something that solves a problem, meets a need, or improves someone’s life, you’re contributing to something greater than yourself. This aligns perfectly with logotherapy’s emphasis on responsibility: you’re taking responsibility for making a difference, even in a small way.

In the context of entrepreneurship, this means shifting your focus from “What am I passionate about?” to “What can I create that will help others?” Passion may not be your starting point, but meaning can emerge as you see the impact of your work.

Think about it this way:

- A tech entrepreneur who creates an app to simplify budgeting may not start out passionate about personal finance — but the positive feedback from users who feel more in control of their money can make the work deeply meaningful.
- A small business owner who starts a cleaning service may not feel passionate about cleaning itself, but the relief and gratitude from clients who regain time with their families can create a strong sense of purpose.

The point is, meaning often comes from seeing how your work benefits others — not from having a deep love for the work itself at the outset.

## How to Apply Logotherapy to Your Entrepreneurial Journey

If meaning is created through action, then the best way to start is to take small, purposeful steps. Here are some practical ways to apply logotherapy’s principles to your entrepreneurial journey:

If meaning is created through action, then the best way to start is to take small, purposeful steps. Here are some practical ways to apply logotherapy’s principles to your entrepreneurial journey:

	1.	Instead of asking, “What am I passionate about?” ask, **“What problems do I notice in the world around me?”** Pay attention to complaints, inefficiencies, or underserved markets. Every problem is an opportunity to create something meaningful. Read [*Blue Ocean Strategy*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4898.Blue_Ocean_Strategy?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11).
	2.	Don’t wait for the “perfect” business idea to strike. Start with small experiments — side hustles, freelance projects, or prototypes — to explore different avenues. Meaning often becomes clearer as you take action and refine your focus. Read [*The Lean Startup*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10127019-the-lean-startup).
	3.	Talk to potential customers, clients, or communities to understand their pain points. The more you connect with others and understand their needs, the more opportunities you’ll see to create something meaningful. Read [*The Mom Test*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52283963-the-mom-test?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_12).
    
Remember that meaning isn’t a static destination — it’s an ongoing process. Be open to evolving your ideas and finding purpose in unexpected places as you grow your business.

## Examples of Meaning Being Created (Not Discovered)

To bring this concept to life, let’s look at a few real-world examples:

- **Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx**\
Blakely didn’t set out to revolutionise women’s fashion. She started with a simple problem: her frustration with traditional undergarments. By solving that problem, she created a product that resonated with millions of women—and found deep meaning in the process.

- **Blake Mycoskie, Founder of TOMS**\
Mycoskie’s passion wasn’t shoes—it was helping children in need. He built TOMS around the idea of giving back, with a “One for One” model that provides a pair of shoes to someone in need for every pair sold. His meaning came from the impact of his business, not an initial passion for footwear.

- **Pat Flynn, Founder of Smart Passive Income**\
Flynn didn’t start out passionate about teaching online business. He stumbled into the niche after losing his job and needing to pivot. Over time, he discovered the joy of helping others succeed, which gave his work deeper purpose.

These stories prove that meaning doesn’t have to be “found” before you begin — it can emerge as you create and contribute.

## Overcoming Common Fears or Objections

I hear you thinking *“What if I never feel fulfilled by what I create?”* 
and *“How do I know if I’m on the right path?”*

Here’s the thing: meaning isn’t guaranteed — it’s cultivated through consistent effort, reflection, and connection with others. You won’t always feel an immediate sense of purpose, but that doesn’t mean it’s not there. The more you contribute, the more clarity you’ll gain.

Also, remember that success isn’t just about you — it’s about the people you serve. By focusing on creating value for others, you’ll naturally build something meaningful.

## Conclusion: Start Creating Meaning Today

If you’re waiting for the perfect passion or purpose to strike, you could be waiting forever. But by taking responsibility and creating something meaningful — whether it’s a business, a project, or a simple act of contribution — you can build a life of purpose and fulfilment.

Remember, as Viktor E. Frankl taught, meaning isn’t discovered — it’s created through action. So, take the first step today. Look for a problem you can solve, start experimenting, and trust that meaning will emerge as you build something bigger than yourself.

Are **you** ready to start?
