summary: 'A reflection on choosing simplicity over style for my website.'
---

In a world full of beautifully designed, interactive, and flashy websites, I decided to go in the opposite direction. My website is simple - some might say boring. No flashy animations, no complex layouts, and no unnecessary distractions.

I’ve built several fancy frontends for this website before landing on this minimalist approach. Unique designs, custom animations, polished layouts - you know the type. Inspired by award-winning portfolio websites. But every time, I hit the same roadblock: I didn’t finish them. I’d get caught up in perfecting the layout or whatever, lose focus, and move on. After several attempts, I realized: I didn't finish it because it didn't really matter to me. That’s when I decided to strip everything back and embrace simplicity.

This website isn’t the end goal - it’s a tool. My primary focus is on the ideas and projects I’m working on, like building businesses (and of course, my day job). This site exists to document and share my journey, not to become the project itself. Keeping it simple ensures I can focus on what really matters.

Sometimes, in a world of noise, simplicity is all you need. This website isn’t here to wow you with design. It’s here to document a journey. If you’ve made it this far, I assume the design hasn't hindered your experience.

Building a fancy, styled website takes time. Time that I’d rather spend writing, exploring ideas, or working on meaningful projects. The goal here wasn’t to impress anyone with design - it was to create a space where I can share my journey quickly and effectively.

Starting simple doesn’t mean staying simple forever. As I grow and evolve, this website will too. That is, unless I forget all about it in a few weeks. It’s a blank canvas that I can refine over time. For now, it serves its purpose: a distraction-free space to document and share ideas.
