summary: 'Why success finds you when you stop chasing and start living the journey.'

**Success is like happiness: the more tightly you hold onto it, the more it slips through your fingers.**

We’ve all been taught to chase - to set goals, work harder, and measure our worth by the results we achieve. But here’s the paradox: success isn’t something you catch. It’s something that finds you when you let go.

Letting go isn’t giving up; it’s shifting focus. It’s about releasing the constant pressure to reach an outcome and embracing the process instead. This isn’t an easy mindset to adopt. After all, we’re surrounded by stories of people who “made it” through relentless effort, as if grit and determination alone were the secret to success.

But what if those stories missed something? What if success came not because they clung so tightly to their goals, but because they created space for creativity, curiosity, and even failure? What if they embraced the journey instead of the destination?

For me, this realization came gradually. I was so fixated on outcomes, coming from a poor upbringing always looking up to the families that were "successful". I was always chasing the next thing, the next milestone, the next achievement. 

That’s when I decided to take a different approach. Instead of obsessing over where I would end up, I began focusing on what matters now. Which to me is learning and sharing. That’s why this website exists - not as a monument to achievements, but as a living document of the journey.

But wait - doesn’t that sound contradictory? You might be thinking, *“Geronimo, isn’t the purpose of this website for you to succeed as an entrepreneur?”*

It’s a fair question. Here’s the difference: this website isn’t about chasing success - it’s about documenting the journey and my growth. The act of writing, reflecting, and exploring my ideas helps me stay present in the process. 

Success isn’t the point. If anything, this website is a reminder to myself to stay curious, keep experimenting, and find joy in the work itself. The beauty of letting go is that it allows space for something unexpected - a new perspective, a fresh idea, or a connection you couldn’t have planned for.

When you let go of the need for success, you create room for the work that truly matters. Instead of obsessing over metrics or milestones, you can focus on building, learning, and contributing. Ironically, that’s often when success shows up - not as a goal achieved, but as a byproduct of meaningful action.

This doesn’t mean abandoning ambition. It means trusting that the process is enough. It means letting go of the illusion of control and embracing the journey, with all its twists, setbacks, and surprises.

**“Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it will elude you, but if you turn your attention to other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder.”** – Henry David Thoreau

Life, work, and success aren’t about chasing. They’re about creating, sharing, and being present for the experience. That’s the journey I’m on.
