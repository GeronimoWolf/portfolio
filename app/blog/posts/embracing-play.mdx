Welcome to a fresh perspective on entrepreneurship.

In his influential work Homo Ludens, cultural historian Johan Huizinga explores how play shapes the very fabric of culture and society. Play is far more than childlike amusement; it’s a cornerstone of human innovation and creativity. It’s about curiosity, discovery, and the freedom to experiment without the burden of failure.

Yet, somewhere along the way, our culture seems to have distanced itself from play. As adults, we gravitate toward seriousness, entertainment, and consumption. But why do we stop climbing trees, playing games with our neighbors, or indulging in spontaneous fun when we grow up? Have we forgotten what it is to play?

As I venture into building a business, I’m revisiting this concept of play - not as an escape from life’s demands but as a framework for embracing life’s potential. Why am I pursuing entrepreneurship? Because, to me, it represents one of the purest forms of play - a dynamic arena where ideas, challenges, and innovation come together in a spirited dance.

## Entrepreneurship as the Ultimate Playground

Building a business is like stepping into a vast, uncharted playground. Each day brings new challenges, creative opportunities, and the thrill of solving puzzles. Entrepreneurship is a canvas where you paint with your ideas, pushing boundaries and exploring unknown territories.

When you adopt a playful mindset, you begin to see obstacles not as roadblocks but as games to master. Imagine treating business hurdles like a challenging level in your favorite video game - each setback is just a chance to try again, refine your strategy, and come back stronger.

This perspective fosters flexibility and resilience, enabling you to pivot quickly and adapt to changing circumstances. In the fast-paced world of startups, these qualities aren’t just advantages—they’re superpowers.

## What Does The E-Myth Teach Us About Play?

If Huizinga explains **why** play matters, Michael E. Gerber’s The E-Myth Revisited outlines **how** play can transform a business. Gerber frames this through the concept of a People Strategy, which treats the workplace as a game - a carefully designed structure where employees can find purpose, test their skills, and engage meaningfully.

According to Gerber, a well-designed game isn’t just a metaphor for work; it’s a functional framework that can inspire and motivate your team. Here are the essential rules for creating this game, based on his insights:

1. **Build the game into the structure:** Don’t retroactively turn your objectives into a game. Design the structure first, with a clear game built into it.
2. **Lead by example:** Never ask your team to play a game you’re not willing to play yourself. You set the tone for engagement and enthusiasm.
3. **Keep it winnable, yet ongoing:** A game should have ways for people to win, but the victory should lead to the next stage rather than an endpoint.
4. **Inject novelty:** Change the tactics of the game periodically to keep it engaging, while staying consistent with the overall strategy.
5. **Maintain the spark:** Don’t assume the game will sustain itself. Regular reminders and communication are essential to keep everyone engaged.
6. **Make it logical:** The game should align with the team’s goals and purpose. If it doesn’t make sense, it won’t resonate.
7. **Add fun:** A game should inspire joy, collaboration, and a sense of accomplishment. Without fun, it’s just another task.
8. **Don’t reinvent the wheel:** If you can’t think of a great game, borrow ideas from others and adapt them to your business.

Anyway, this will come up again when I talk about creating/building a business.

## Rediscovering the Joy of the Journey

Entrepreneurship is about so much more than hitting milestones or growing profits - it’s about the journey itself. When you infuse that journey with play, the process becomes lighter, more joyful, and infinitely more rewarding.

Why is this important? Because when the journey is enjoyable, it frees you to focus on what truly matters: creating value, making a difference, and building something that resonates. A playful mindset brings clarity and resilience, allowing you to approach challenges with optimism and determination.

In the grand game of life, the ultimate goal isn’t just to win - it’s to play wholeheartedly.
