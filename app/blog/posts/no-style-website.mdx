title: 'Why I Built a Simple, No-Style Website'

summary: 'A reflection on choosing simplicity over style for my website.'
---

In a world full of beautifully designed, interactive, and flashy websites, I decided to go in the opposite direction. My website is simple - some might say boring. No flashy animations, no complex layouts, and no unnecessary distractions.

I’ve built several fancy frontends for this website before landing on this minimalist approach. Unique designs, custom animations, polished layouts - you know the type. The the kind of portfolio websites you see from ‘creatives' winning awards. But every time, I hit the same roadblock: I didn’t finish them. I’d get caught up in the styling, lose focus, and move on. After several attempts, I realized: I didn't finish it because it didn't really matter. That’s when I decided to strip everything back and embrace simplicity.

Sometimes, in a world of noise, simplicity is all you need. This website isn’t here to wow you with design. It’s here to document a journey. If you’ve made it this far, I assume the design hasn't hindered your experience.

### Not My Main Objective

This website isn’t the end goal - it’s a tool. My primary focus is on the ideas and projects I’m working on, like building businesses (and of course, my day job). This site exists to document and share my journey, not to become the project itself. Keeping it simple ensures I can focus on what really matters.

### Done Is Better Than Perfect

Building a fancy, styled website takes time. Time that I’d rather spend writing, exploring ideas, or working on meaningful projects. The goal here wasn’t to impress anyone with design - it was to create a space where I can share my journey quickly and effectively.

### The MVP Mindset

This website is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). It does what it needs to do, nothing more. It’s a functional starting point that leaves room to grow.

### Room to Grow

Starting simple doesn’t mean staying simple forever. As I grow and evolve, this website will too. It’s a blank canvas that I can refine over time. For now, it serves its purpose: a distraction-free space to document and share ideas.
